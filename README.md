# Movie Catalogue Visualization Project
## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of Amazon S3 and Amazon QuickSight to store, analyze, and visualize a catalogue of TV shows and movies. The project involves uploading data to S3, connecting it to QuickSight, and creating various visualizations to analyze the dataset.

## Project Steps

1. **Creation of S3 & Data Upload to Amazon S3**
   - Uploaded the TV/movie catalogue dataset to an Amazon S3 bucket.
   - This step ensures data is stored securely and is easily accessible for analysis.
